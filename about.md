## About Me

<img src="/stewie.png" alt="NoImageFound" width="165spx" height="200px">


Hey there! I’m Stackxbyte aka c00l_k3d, your friendly neighborhood cybersecurity enthusiast. I’m all about reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and anything that gets me into the nitty-gritty of how systems tick.

When I’m not diving deep into the code, I’m learning the ropes of Linux kernel exploitation and getting my hands dirty with low-level programming in C and assembly. I’m also a proud Linux user with a growing interest in embedded systems and IoT. While I currently know very little about IoT and hardware, I’m excited to explore and learn more about these areas in the future. My big dream? To uncover a zero-day and make a splash in the security world! one-day. 

In my free time, I love to dive into OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) investigations and play CTF (Capture The Flag) with my team. This site is my playground where I share my adventures, discoveries, and a few geeky insights along the way. If you’re into hacking, coding, or just want to chat about the coolest things in cybersecurity, let’s connect!
